# wickpy
The purpose of this package is to do the automatic expansion of correlation
function for any scalar field up to the arbitrary precision, perform all wick
contractions, calculate corresponding symmetry factors and draw the diagrams.

For example for the two fields:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%3C%5COmega%7CT%5C%7B%5Cphi%28x%29%5Cphi%28y%29%5C%7D%7C%5COmega%3E%3D%5Cfrac%7B%3C0%7CT%5C%7B%5Cphi_I%28x%29%5Cphi_I%28y%29%5Cexp%5B-i%5Cint%20dtH_I%28t%29%5D%5C%7D%7C0%3E%7D%7B%3C0%7CT%5C%7B%5Cexp%5B-i%5Cint%20dtH_I%28t%29%5D%5C%7D%7C0%3E%7D)

The numerator and denominator are expanded and drawn separately and
vacuum-bubble cancellation is made apparent. Finally, remaining diagrams are
drawn with proper symmetry factors.

Done for fun and educational purposes.
